# Design and Implementation of a Diabetic Disease Identification Algorithm Based on Data Mining - Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the data mining and modeling process aimed at predicting diabetes using various classifier models. The analysis is conducted in the 'Diabeties.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Mining and Modeling

In the data mining and modeling process, we explore popular classifier models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. Additionally, we apply advanced models such as XGBoost, CATBoost, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM. The evaluation is based on performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to predict diabetes classifications. The goal is to identify the best-performing model for our specific requirements.

## Model Evaluation

All models have shown excellent performance, achieving accuracy scores ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. The AUC scores indicate strong performance, with values close to 1.0. Choosing the best model depends on specific project requirements. However, based on the analysis, CatBoost stands out with the highest accuracy (0.98) and AUC (1.00). CatBoost is known for its robust handling of categorical features and consistently strong out-of-the-box performance.

## Diabeties.ipynb
