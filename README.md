## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that can effectively identify diabetic disease in patients using data mining techniques. The algorithm aims to enhance early detection and diagnosis for improved treatment and disease management.

## Methodology

Our approach involves leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing patient information, including medical records, lab results, and lifestyle factors. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm development, and model evaluation, with the objective of providing a reliable and accurate system for diabetic disease identification.

## Usage

To use the Diabetic Disease Identification Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the algorithm using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
4. Input your dataset for prediction (ensure it follows the same format as the provided dataset).

Please refer to the project's documentation and Jupyter notebooks for detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this research consists of 1,564 rows and includes socio-demographic factors. For detailed information about the dataset, please refer to the [Dataset folder](dataset).
