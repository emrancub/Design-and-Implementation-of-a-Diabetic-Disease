## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that can identify diabetic disease in patients using data mining techniques. The algorithm is aimed at improving the early detection and diagnosis of diabetes, which is crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease.

## Methodology

Our approach involves utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of patient information, such as medical records, lab results, and lifestyle factors. The steps involved in the methodology include data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm development, and model evaluation. We aim to provide a reliable and accurate system for diabetic disease identification.

## Usage

To use the Diabetic Disease Identification Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the algorithm using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
4. Input your dataset for prediction (ensure it follows the same format as the provided dataset).

Please refer to the project's documentation and Jupyter notebooks for detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm effectively.

## Dataset
