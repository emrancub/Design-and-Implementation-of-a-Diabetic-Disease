## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that can effectively identify diabetic disease in patients using data mining techniques. The algorithm aims to enhance early detection and diagnosis for improved treatment and disease management.

## Methodology

Our approach involves leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing patient information, including medical records, lab results, and lifestyle factors. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm development, and model evaluation, with the objective of providing a reliable and accurate system for diabetic disease identification.

## Usage

To use the Diabetic Disease Identification Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/emrancub/Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Diabetic-Disease.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the `code` folder:
     ```bash
     cd your-repository/code
     ```

3. **Run the Algorithm:**
   - Open the 'diabeties.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook located in the `code` folder.
   - Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can use the following command:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook diabeties.ipynb
     ```

4. **Input Your Dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from the [Dataset folder](dataset).
   - Ensure your dataset follows the same format as the provided dataset, with relevant columns and data types.

5. **Follow Documentation:**
   - Refer to the project's documentation within the 'diabeties.ipynb' notebook for detailed instructions on using the algorithm effectively.

Feel free to explore and modify the algorithm based on your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to refer to the documentation or reach out for assistance.
